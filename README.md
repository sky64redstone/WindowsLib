# WindowsLib

This Library is divided into smaller Projects:

## Window
Uses the <Windows.h> header file to create a window.<br/>
Gdiplus is used to load images. (only for now, later I write a loader by myself)<br/>

## Socket
Uses the <WinSock2.h> and <ws2tcpip.h> header files to interact with the SOCKET objects!

## Sound
Uses the <mmsystem.h> and <Windows.h> header files to play Sound-Files
